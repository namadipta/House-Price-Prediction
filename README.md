        A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market.The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
